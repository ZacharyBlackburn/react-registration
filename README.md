# Registration user interface created with React for healthcare providers

## Takes in various inputs and sets them to local storage

This is a basic single-page React app that presents users with a registration form - upon registering, the values
of the inputs are saved to local storage. There is a login button as well - this button is a skeleton and has
no functionality.
